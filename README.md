I read this book called _Nudge_ by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein, and in the book, a story was told about one of the author's coworkers. The coworker had been hired out of a graduate program to teach at the school. When the colleague was hired, he had not yet completed his thesis. Due to this, he was initially hired as a lecturer but would be promoted into an assistant professor position once his thesis was completed. Despite this potential for financial gain, the colleague struggled to complete his thesis. To help his colleague, the author developed a plan focused on loss instead of gain. The colleague wrote the author several $100 checks, dated for the first day of the upcoming months. If the colleague did not complete a chapter of his thesis by the first of the month, the author would cash the check and use the money on a party that the colleague wasn't invited to.

I set up a similar program with my sister and this repo hosts the results. In my current job, I'm doing a lot of SQL and my coding skill a utilized a little less than I'd like. Likewise, my writing skills have been deteriorating over the past few years despite completing a master's degree. These are both skills that I want to improve upon but haven't had the right motivation to do so. The prospect of losing $100 will hopefully provide the added incentive that gets me to work.
